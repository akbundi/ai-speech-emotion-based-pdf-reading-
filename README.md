The Emotion-Based PDF Reading App is a unique application that enhances the traditional PDF reading experience by incorporating emotion detection and voice modulation. This innovative app allows users to open and read PDF documents while experiencing the content with added emotional context. When a user opens a PDF file using the app, they have the option to select a specific emotion or let the app automatically detect the emotion based on the content.
